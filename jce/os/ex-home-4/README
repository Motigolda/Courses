Ex4 - Polynomial Calculator

==Description==
This program is a calculator focused on polynomial calculating.
Enter your polynomial in this format: POLYNOMIAL, X0
Where POLYNOMIAL is your polynomial without spaces and X0 is the x you want to solve the polynomial for.
Example: 2x^2+3x^3, 6

For exit, type "done".

The calculation itself implemented twice:
1) Using threads
2) Using processes and shared memory

The threads implementation can be found in the file ex4a.c.
The processes one can be found in the file ex4b.c

Note that compilation with -Wall flag will warn about pragmas. 
Pragma directives are used to make an order in the file and should be ignored by the compiler. 
==Program Files==
ex4a.c - Threads implementation
ex4b.c - Processes implemenetation

==How to compile?==
ex3a.c:
    gcc ex4a.c -o ex4a -lm -lpthread  
ex3b.c:
    gcc ex4b.c -o ex4b -lm -lpthread
