==Description==
This program gets string where its maximum length is 509 (510 - null terminator) chars.
For each string it returns the word count and the char count of the string:
- Word Count stands for the number of sequences that contains non-space, newline or null-terminator chars in the string.
- Char Count stands for the number of characters that are not spaces, newlines and null-terminators in the string.
In addition, the program saves the history of the strings that entered to it.
To parse a string, just enter it.
For watching in the history, type "history"
For exit, type "exit".

==Program Files==
main.c - the program with all the functions and logic
Makefile - gnu make file, for easy compiling the code. 
history.txt - the default history file. created after the first running of the code.
README - this explanation file :) 
bin/ - if make file is used, the binary of the code will be created there.

==How to compile?==
compile:
    The compilation can be done in two different ways:
        1.  The recommended one is to run the command "make all", where is the directory that contains the Makefile.
            This command will create bin directory and compile the main.c into word_counter.
        2.  Other way is to compile it using gcc:
            gcc main.c -o main
            
run:
    The compiling method that selected changes the output file path and name:
        1.  If selected the gnu "make all", run using: 
            ./bin/word_counter
        2.  If selected the other way, then run using:
            ./main
